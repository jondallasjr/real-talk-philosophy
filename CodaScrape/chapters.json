I am a certified philosophical counselor and help people all over the world apply philosophy to their life problems and mental health issues.\n​\nI have founded several university organizations (including Real Talk @Pitt, and BridgePittsburgh) specifically aimed at bringing people together for civil disagreement, where I helped people practice one thing: perceiving contradictory information as a thrill, rather than a threat. I have a knack for making people comfortable with exploring ideas freely!\n"
