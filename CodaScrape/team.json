I have Master's degrees in philosophy from Texas Tech University (focused on Ethics and Aesthetics, resulting in an Ethics Certificate) and Johns Hopkins University (focused on systems of thought), as well as a PhD in History and Philosophy of Science from the University of Pittsburgh. I am a certified philosophical counselor and help people all over the world apply philosophy to their life problems and mental health issues.\n​\nI have founded several university organizations (including Real Talk @Pitt, and BridgePittsburgh) specifically aimed at bringing people together for civil disagreement, where I helped people practice one thing: perceiving contradictory information as a thrill, rather than a threat. I have a knack for making people comfortable with exploring ideas freely!\n",
