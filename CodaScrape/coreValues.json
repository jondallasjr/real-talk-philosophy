            "Description": "I woke up around 5am, left Jess in bed, and worked on the veranda some. When Jess awoke, we shared breakfast and tea over a game of chess. At 8am I taught my first ashtanga yoga class at She of Earth. Then a quick shop at Kava with Jess. Vegetable pies for lunch. \nI worked on the veranda today, listening to a Spotify Radio based on Sufjan Stevens. A rainstorm came and I had to take down all that was on the clothesline. Thankfully it had mostly dried. The day stayed mostly gray. \nPast Events: Today I mostly worked on converting all of our past event details from Google Sheets to Coda /_suZma. This required creating a new /_suQ_M table. \nMetrics: One of the most incredible things about Coda is that all of the different spreadsheets all communicate seamlessly with one another. This made creating a metrics sheet a snap. \nCurrency Conversion: Migrating over historical financial information is tricky. In Google Sheets, I used its built-in currency converter to more easily hand calculations. But exchange rates today are very different than they were years ago, so the information is no longer technically accurate. Instead of calculating currency conversion in the spreadsheet, I’ll \nProjects: I also created a new /_suYUt page with all projects that are currently active, on hiatus, complete, or planned for the future. This is now linked in Coda to our /_suWpE and /_suMNT tables.\nPress: I also updated the /_suYqS page with a Google search for “Hanoi Philosophy Forum”\nAround 2pm I treated myself to a glass of wine. Maybe I’ll have another before the day is through [edit: I did]. \nThere has been some tension (just a bit) between me and Jess about my desire to continue working on this project while she wants us to have an easy, relaxed time transitioning to life in Zimbabwe. She has taken me on some excellent adventures to Mana Pools, Nyanga, Mukuvisi, and Ngomakurira. And she doesn’t want me to fret about work right now. \nFor better or for worse, so much of my sense of self-worth and identity is tied up in Opening Up. And most of my social network for the last several years has come from these events. I’m pretty socially awkward otherwise. And Jess first met me at a Opening Up event and fell in love with me while I was leading weekly events. I can’t help but think that a part of her attraction to me is based on being the MC at live events. I’ve always considered Opening Up to, in a way, be a bower. \nNow we’re off to a family quiz night! \n",

Cuddled in bed, smashed the NY Times Thursday Crossword (our favorite day) over breakfast, then studied world geography with an app. Kibbles and bone broth for Maxy. Then I did the dishes while listening to a Hidden Brain episode on the evolution of marriage. \nToday’s Plan\nToday I’d like to set up a proper public blog Doc on Coda. One that is different from the Doc I’m currently using (which contains many unpolished ideas that aren’t for public eyes). \nToday’s Accomplishments\nWell, I did not achieve what I set out to achieve, but I got several things done anyway.\nAdded a Dashboard: I set up a new Dashboard view in the Team Doc on Coda.io for any team members to see the most important information\nAdded System for Announcements: I added a view to the dashboard of the Notes table. This shows only entries labeled as Announcements and that have not yet been marked as read by the current logged-in user. \nActive Recurring Tasks: Having a list of recurring tasks to complete every day/week/month/year is really useful. But I realized today that I’ve added many recurring tasks to the list that will be necessary only once a team is formed again and once we have active events. But right now, we don’t \nCleared Email: I haven’t checked my inbox since the collapse of events in Colorado Springs (and subsequent choice to put all events on hiatus). Today I worked through about 1,200 emails, setting up automatic filters in Gmail. \n",

            "Description": "Incest, or sexual relationships between close family members, is a controversial topic, and there are philosophical arguments on both sides of the debate about whether or not it should be criminalized.\nOne argument in favor of criminalizing incest is that it can be harmful to the individuals involved, both physically and emotionally. Incestuous relationships may be associated with an increased risk of physical harm, such as sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies, as well as emotional harm, such as feelings of shame, guilt, and isolation. Additionally, some argue that incest is a form of abuse, as it involves a power imbalance between family members and may involve coercion or manipulation.\nOn the other hand, some argue that criminalizing incest infringes upon the right to personal autonomy and privacy. Some people believe that consenting adults should be able to make their own decisions about their relationships, regardless of whether or not those relationships are considered taboo or socially unacceptable. Some also argue that criminalizing incest disproportionately affects marginalized communities, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, who may face discrimination and persecution for engaging in relationships that are considered \"deviant\" or \"unnatural.\"\nUltimately, the decision to criminalize incest involves weighing the potential harm that may be caused by such relationships against the right to personal autonomy and privacy. It is a complex and sensitive issue that requires careful consideration of a variety of ethical and moral factors.",

            "Description": "There are both potential health benefits and risks associated with the use of nicotine vape pens.\nOn the positive side, some research suggests that using nicotine vape pens may be less harmful than smoking cigarettes. This is because e-cigarettes do not produce the same harmful byproducts as cigarettes, such as tar and carbon monoxide. Additionally, nicotine vape pens can provide a way for people to wean themselves off of cigarettes and potentially quit smoking altogether.\nHowever, there are also potential risks associated with the use of nicotine vape pens. Some research has suggested that the chemicals used in e-cigarette liquids may be harmful when inhaled. In addition, nicotine itself is a highly addictive substance, and using nicotine vape pens can lead to dependence and withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit. There have also been reports of serious respiratory issues, including lung injury and death, associated with the use of some e-cigarette products.\nIt is important to note that the long-term health effects of using nicotine vape pens are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits. If you are considering using a nicotine vape pen, it is important to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits, and to discuss your options with a healthcare professional.",

            "Description": "There are several logical fallacies that may be committed in arguments for and against eating meat. Some common examples include:\nAd hominem: This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making the argument, rather than addressing the argument itself. For example, someone might say “you can’t trust vegans, they’re all preachy and self-righteous” as a way to dismiss an argument made by a vegan.\nStraw man: This fallacy occurs when someone misrepresents or exaggerates an opposing argument in order to make it easier to attack. For example, someone might argue that vegans believe that all animal agriculture is inherently wrong, even though this may not be the case.\nAppeal to authority: This fallacy occurs when someone appeals to the authority or expertise of someone else as a way to support their argument, without providing any actual evidence. For example, someone might argue that we should eat meat because “experts say it’s healthy,” without providing any actual evidence from experts to support their claim.\nSlippery slope: This fallacy occurs when someone suggests that a small change will lead to a series of unintended and undesirable consequences. For example, someone might argue that if we stop eating meat, it will lead to the collapse of the entire agricultural industry.\nFalse dilemma: This fallacy occurs when someone presents two options as if they are the only ones available, when in fact there may be other options. For example, someone might argue that we must either eat meat or starve, when in fact there are many plant-based sources of protein and other nutrients.",

And this is where most of the action takes place day to day. \nWe have a big team spread out all over the world in the US, the UK, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia. But here, it’s just me. \nSuthaphat was able to come over for a bit today; that was nice. \nSo, at the time of recording, 6 July 2021, we have had 229 events in 8 cities for 8,292 guests. But, all of our chapters are currently shut down due to Coronavirus. \nThat hasn’t stopped us though. We are still working on a lot here at Real Talk! \nChiang Mai: We are prepping for our first event in Chiang Mai, Thailand since December, which will be happening this Thursday. \nOnline: We have also been working to move the in-person experience online. \nWe’ve recorded and edited lecture videos for several topics including psychedelics, polyamory, the origins of sexual orientation, the ethics of comedy, and the psychological differences between easterners and westerners. \nWe’ve also been creating online games and quizzes for guests to play during our online events. \nAnd we’ve been working with the developers at Junto to help create our first automated online events \nPresentations: We’ve been migrating all of our most popular presentations from Keynote, which is Mac’s version of Powerpoint, to Google Slides so more people can collaborate and to integrate more easily with other systems. \nAnd updating our presentations with legal, licensed images from our partners at Envato Elements\nUSA: We’ve also been preparing for our expansion to the United States \nApplying to accelerators and incubators/ \nApplying to pitch to Investors, which is challenging from abroad. \nApplying to post on university job boards looking for Local Chapter Leaders \nResearch: Our Research Team has continued to create new content for future explorations\nWebsite: We’ve been updating our website, giving anyone access to all of our research for free, hopefully as a way to spread the word about our online and in-person events events. \nAdmin: We’ve been revamping the way our team tracks their hours and communicates their progress \nEFL: Developing our EFL (English as a Foreign Language) program\nCreating vocabulary sheets\nCreating course completion certificates \nHosted demo lessons \nCreated marketing materials ",

            "Description": "Summary\nBefore hosting full events (i.e. events with music, artwork, etc.), LCLs are asked to first host regularly scheduled, free, MVP events in parks, libraries, etc. until their regular attendance reaches at least 25 non-staff guests. It is 100% our hope that these events will ”graduate” to full Opening Up Philosophy Events. \n“Dream big; start small.” \n\nWhat are “MVP” Events? \nMVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. What is required at minimum to produce a Opening Up event? \nA host \nGuests\nA topic\nDiscussion Questions\nMVP Events do not (i.e. needn’t necessarily) offer experts, music, artwork, presentations, haiku/drawing contests, games, etc. As events progress, the inclusion of additional Event Elements is encouraged, but not required. \nMVP events are offered for free/donation. As such, we try to elliminate event costs (e.g. advertising, paid-venues, etc.).  \nRationale\nAsking LCLs to host free MVP events before hosting full Opening Up Events has many benefits. \nAccelerated Onboarding: Rather than asking LCLs to complete a months-long onboarding process peraring for rather complex events (including music, games, etc.), LCLs can instead begin hosting MVP events within a number of weeks.\nHost Practice: Hosting MVP Events will allow LCLs the opportunity to practice facilitating divisive issue conversations. They will grow an understanding of the art of discussion facilitation without concern for all the other bells and whistles. \nGradual Event Complexity Build: Ideally, the events will grow increasingly, incrementally complex over time. Additional Event Elements (e.g. music, artwork) will be added slowly according to the LCL’s comfort. \nGradual Team Build: Hosting MVP Events will allow potential collaborators (e.g. visual artists, musicians, volunteers, etc.) to sign-up, join the local team, and understand the intention and “vibe” of our events. \nGradual Community Build: Hosting free MVP events will allow the local community to grow familiar with our events and ensure that these events are even wanted. Hosting free events will also allow some to join and build the community who may not be able to join once the events are not free. \nLCL Empowerment: Expecting new LCLs to begin hosting full RTP events requires a lot of specific direction and decision-making from the Central Team, decreasing LCL involvement in top-level decision making for the chapter. This accelerated MVP system will allow local chapters to develop slowly, organicaly, allowing LCLs to understand more fully the events, event responsibilities, and their audience, before launching into full RTP events. \nDecreased Central Responsibility: Much of the Central Team’s responsibility has been putting out fires caused by expecting LCLs to host full RTP events too quickly. This accelerated MVP system will decrease the need for Central involvement \nDecreased Central Financial Exposure: Gauranteeing LCL salaries comes at a great financial risk for the Central Team. \nProvided Resources\nTopical Google Slides Presentation\nThe intention of providing the Topical Google Slides Presentation is not for LCLs to present the presentation (this only occurs once the event is \nHosting Outline & Suggested Scripts\nDiscussion Questions\nHealthy Conversation Guidelines\nAgenda of MVP Events\nPre-Requisites\nPost an event online \nExplore and attempt to fully understand the arguments on both sides of the topic/issue\nPrint discussion questions, healthy conversation, necessary announcements, and email and team signup forms\nSetup\nThe LCL sets up the space to be comfortable and inviting (e..g with signs, blankets, pillows, tea, etc.) \nThe LCL sets up the email and team signup forms\nGuest Arrival & Individual Welcomes: Guests arrive at the space. They don’t know exactly where to go, who to talk to, etc. As guests arrive, the host welcomes them individually, hands them conversation guidelines and questions, and leads them to join small-group discussion groups. \nSmall-Group Discussion Questions #1: Guests are invited to form groups of 3-5 to explore pre-devised questions related to the topic.\nSummary of Both Sides: The host will speak for 5-10 minutes ad hoc exploring the major arguments on each side of the topic. \nSmall-Group Discussion Questions #2: Guests are invited to form NEW groups of 3-5 to explore pre-devised questions related to the topic.\nAfter Party: Guests are invited to stay and continue conversing in a less structured context. \nPossible Free Locations\nPark\nLibrary\nBeach\nCafe\nBar\nRestaurant\nRecreation Center\nScript\n",

            "Visibility": "Public",
            "Add  to Tasks": "",
            "Description": "“What’s in a name?” For us, quite a lot. The name of our organization is a moniker that rencompasses all of our countless guests, events, staff, contributors, content, resources, songs, artwork, games, etc. Our name is the very first thing people hear about us and our #1 marketing tool. \nThe Hanoi Philosophy Forum\nWe began in March 2017 as The Hanoi Philosophy Forum. Back then, we were little more than a philosophy book club, exploring books like Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil, Foucault’s The History of Madness, or Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling. We were located in Hanoi; we read philosophy; and we weren’t just lecture-based but a forum. The name was clear and direct (and easily understood by non-native english speakers). \nBy September 2018, it became clear that our attendees came because they were desperate for a space to candidly talk about important issues, not just academic philosophy. Our focus shifted away from academic philosophy and towards divisive social issues (e.g. polyamory, toxic masculinity, veganism, etc). Also around this time, to make the events more entertaining and appealing, we started incorporating themed artwork, music, and games. We wanted these events to be accessible to all, but “philosophy” conjured up images of old, white men smoking pipes debating the definition of dialectical materialism. The term “philosophy” was intimidating, cumbersome, and no longer a good match for us. \nWe started brainstorming hundreds of potential new names (e.g. The Other Side, The Depolarization Project, Likewise), but every time we fell in love with one, we discovered to our chagrin that the URL was already taken or a Facebook page already existed. So, despite the name:vision mismatch, HPF persisted. \nReal Talk Philosophy\nIn 2020 we began expanding operations internationally from Vietnam to Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and the US. A new name, one unlinked from any particular locale, was necessary. Through a series of intense discussions with our most loyal members, we voted for the name Real Talk Philosophy (#2 was Nomad Philosophy Forum). \nAdopting a new name is no easy task. In addition to updating website URLs, Social Media handles, logos, marketing materials, and website content; changing the name of an organization requires the consideration of legal registrations, financial account information, and trademarks. Also, we lose some familiarity and street-cred each time we switch to a new name. \nUrban Dictionary defines Real Talk as “The philosophy of talking candidly and openly and honestly without fear of what others might think” and “usually for another's benefit to let them know of something that is typically hard to discuss.” This is a 100% match for the kind of space we want to create. Real Talk easily rolls off the tongue; it’s colloquial, memorable, and easy to type. Real Talk highlights that we are discussion-based, and juxtaposes well against our arch-nemesis, the reviled “small talk.” \nBut, unfortunately, we found that Real Talk is also ubiquitous, trite almost (just search for podcasts, articles, apps, magazines, school newspaper columns, etc. sharing this name). And where tried were to attempt to overcome this by tacking on “Philosophy,” the name became unnecessarily cumbersome, too difficult to type, and too long to put on an event poster. It’s also a bit arrogant. ‘Forget about that silly fake talk they’re having over there; here we have REAL talk!’ \nOpening Up\nIn early 2022, the prolonged COVID rules on public gatherings forced us to make the difficult decision to put all chapters on indefinite hiatus. I was, for the first time in 5 years, able to take a break, a step back, a rest. \nWhile reading Michael Singer’s The Untethered Soul, a single phrase kept reappearing and concretizing in my mind - “open up.” One bit of Michael’s advice that I found poignant: whenever your mind is stuck on some problem, some persistent negative thought, whenever the world feels like it is collapsing, rather than try to push the thought away, simply practice “opening up.” Open up to all the sounds and sights in the space around you; to any smells, tastes, or physical sensations. Open up to everything you have to be grateful for.\nOpening up means to explore, inspect, and dissect with curiosity. It means to speak vulnerably, honestly, and emotionally. Opening up means to release a covering, to allow things to more easily flow in and flow out. It refers to starting a new novel, a new adventure; to being a novice, not an expert. In a game of billiards, Opening Up means to clear the table so the good game can begin, without all the rubbish getting in the way.\nAnd best of all, the .org was available for purchase! This final step of adopting a new name has so often undermined us in the past. \n\n",

            "Description": "The domestication of dogs is a complex process that likely occurred over thousands of years, and the exact timeline is still a subject of ongoing research. However, some key milestones in the evolution of dogs include:\n20,000-30,000 years ago: Early human societies begin to settle down and form communities, leading to the formation of a symbiotic relationship between humans and wolves. Wolves that were more tolerant of human presence were more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, their offspring became increasingly domesticated.\n15,000-20,000 years ago: Dogs have evolved to the point where they are visibly different from wolves, and have developed a number of traits that are associated with domestication, such as smaller teeth and jaws, shorter snouts, and rounder skulls.\n10,000-15,000 years ago: Humans begin to selectively breed dogs for specific traits, such as hunting ability, herding ability, or guarding ability. This leads to the development of different breeds of dogs, each with their own set of characteristics and abilities.\n5,000-10,000 years ago: The earliest known dog breeds, such as the Saluki, the Basenji, and the Afghan Hound, are believed to have emerged around this time. These breeds were likely developed for specific hunting or herding tasks.\n2,000-5,000 years ago: The ancient Egyptians and Greeks begin to breed dogs for specific purposes, such as hunting and guarding. This leads to the development of a number of new breeds, including the Mastiff, the Greyhound, and the Spitz.\n1,000 years ago: Many of the breeds that we know today begin to emerge, such as the Poodle, the Labrador Retriever, and the Bulldog. These breeds were likely developed for specific tasks such as retrieving game, herding livestock, and guarding property.\nIt’s worth noting that this is a very rough timeline and that various researchers may have different opinions and details on the exact timing and development of different breeds.",

            "Description": "The domestication of cats is a less well-understood process than the domestication of dogs, but some key milestones in the evolution of domestic cats include:\n10,000-12,000 years ago: The domestication of cats is believed to have begun around this time, as early human settlements began to accumulate large amounts of grain and other foodstuffs, which attracted wild felines (proto-domestic cats) that preyed on the rodents that were attracted to the stored food.\n8,000-10,000 years ago: The first evidence of cats living in close association with humans is found in the Near East.\n4,000-5,000 years ago: Cats were domesticated by the ancient Egyptians, who valued them for their ability to control rodents.\n2,000-3,000 years ago: Cats were spread throughout the Mediterranean by Roman traders and merchants, and were valued for their hunting abilities.\n1,000 years ago: The earliest known cat breeds, such as the Siamese and the Persian, are believed to have emerged around this time. These breeds were likely developed for specific aesthetic or behavioral characteristics.\nIt’s worth noting that the timeline for cat domestication is less clear and less studied than that of dogs, and some researchers have argued that cats were never fully domesticated and have instead adopted a symbiotic relationship with humans. Also, as with the dog timeline, different researchers may have different opinions on the exact timing and development of different breeds.",

Would you be interested in hosting a new weekly event? \nChapter Name is looking for a new home to host our weekly events, each with music, artwork, games, presentations, community conversations, and more.\nSince 2017 Opening Up has hosted more than 200 community events exploring contemporary, divisive issues (like polyamory, psychedelics, feminism, conspiracy theories, fetishes, etc.) with guided small-group discussions, unbiased talks, themed music, artwork, games, and more. Events in Da Nang, Hanoi, and Chiang Mai range from 40-130 guests per event. See our explainer video at www.youtu.be/RNpl2oWi3ug or find out more at www.openingup.org. \nOur events are 2.5 hours long, and are scheduled for eating hours, so most people order food and several drinks. This is an excellent opportunity for venues to find more customers. \nOur events require a projector and screen (or large television), microphone and speakers, and seating for 30-40+ people. Could your venue accommodate? \nWe would like to host our first event in city on date. Once you and I confirm, my team will begin advertising. \nThanks so much!\nName\nOf course, spicing up the email with more local, colloquial jargon is invited.",

            "Description": "In conversations around divisive social issues, the word “should” can come up a lot. For example, you might hear “The government should pay for tertiary education” or “you should be able to stomach killing an animal if you’re willing to eat meat.” \nBut what does the word “should” mean? \nIn conversations where we want our beliefs to be understood by others (and hopefully learn something about ourselves through the process), it can be really beneficial to \nThe word “should” is lazy. What I mean is, the word “should” can be used in a variety of circumstances where it would be beneficial for someone to do something. But “should” is unspecific as to what that benefit might be (or what detriment it might be shielding us from). And identifying the specific benefits and detriments is exactly what’s necessary when attempting to inform someone of what we believe. And it is the only way to understand in ourselves why we believe what we believe. \nPlease include information about the etymology of the word “should” and if it ever had moral/religious connotations. \nPlease include any other topics that would be relatively on-topic and/or entertaining\nUse a friendly, playful, humble, philosophical tone\nPlease add examples\nPlease define any jargon\nPlease include any studies or scholastic work that have been written on the subject\n\n—\nAI Generated:\nThe Pitfalls of Using the Word \"Should\"\nIntroduction\nThe word \"should\" is often used in conversations to express a belief or expectation about what someone else ought to do or think. For example, you might hear someone say, \"You should be more concerned about immigrants at the border\" or \"You should be able to stomach killing an animal if you're willing to eat meat.\" While the word \"should\" can be a useful tool for expressing our beliefs, it can also be problematic as it tends to be unspecific and may not adequately explain the reasons behind a particular belief or policy. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and even conflict.\nIn this guide, we will explore the problems with using the word \"should\" in conversations, and offer strategies for promoting healthier and more productive dialogues. \nThe Meaning of \"Should\"\n\"Should\" is a modal verb that is used to express obligation, expectation, or advisability. It is derived from the Old English word \"sceolde,\" which means \"obligation\" or \"duty.\" \nInterestingly, \"should\" is a past tense form of the word \"shall,\" which originally meant \"owe\" or \"be under obligation.\" \"Shall\" and \"should\" were once interchangeable, with \"shall\" used for first person subjects (I, we) and \"should\" used for second and third person subjects (you, he/she/it/they). However, over time, \"shall\" became more associated with expressing a future intention, while \"should\" retained its obligation or expectation connotations.\nIn the past, “should” was used to talk about what was expected of someone based on religious beliefs. Today, \"should\" has evolved to have a more general meaning, and it is often used to express opinions or recommendations without necessarily invoking any specific moral or religious code.\nThe Pitfalls of Using \"Should\"\nThe word \"should\" can be problematic when used in conversations, as it can be vague and unspecific. For example, saying \"You should recycle more\" doesn't really explain why you believe that or how it would benefit the environment. Additionally, using \"should\" can come across as prescriptive or judgmental, which can put the listener on the defensive and make them less likely to engage in a productive conversation.\nStrategies for Promoting Healthier Conversations\nInstead of using \"should,\" it is more effective to use specific and descriptive language that explains the benefits and drawbacks of a particular action or belief. For example, instead of saying \"You should go vegan,\" you might explain the health benefits of a plant-based diet or the environmental impact of animal agriculture. Additionally, using open-ended questions and active listening can help promote healthier and more productive conversations. By asking questions that invite different perspectives and listening actively to what others have to say, we can foster a more inclusive and collaborative dialogue.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, using the word \"should\" in conversations can be problematic as it tends to be unspecific and may not adequately explain the reasons behind a particular belief or policy. Instead, using descriptive language and open-ended questions can help promote healthier and more productive conversations, even on divisive issues. By explaining the benefits and drawbacks of a particular belief or policy, we can encourage a more informed and respectful dialogue, and find common ground with others who may have different perspectives.",
