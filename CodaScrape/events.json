The ambiance was electric with honesty, vulnerability, hilarious interruptions and some serious thought-provoking discussions.\nI would like to thank The Jam Tree, not just for their delicious food and drinks, but also for turning their fantastic venue into our little safe haven where we could strip down our biases and pretenses, and explore an issue as serious as Toxic Masculinity.\nImmense gratitude goes out to Michael Watson, who not only shared his remarkable journey and wisdom but challenged the existing discourse around the topic. His views and beliefs moved the conversation from the usual clichés to the real issues at hand.\nOur very own LoveDale Makalanga is due a gargantuan 'thank you' for his heartfelt song—a beautiful symphony that captured the dilemma and complex emotions encompassing Toxic Masculinity. His melodious lines kept us swaying between laughter and, dare I say, a tear or two.\nLucy Kirkman, oh where do we even start with her? Thank you, Lucy, for your mesmerizing artwork which served as a mirror to our society, showcasing the emotional turbulence within the theme we explored.\nBut wait! Not one to shy away from more responsibility, LoveDale Makalanga once again graced us, not just on stage, but behind the scenes as well, managing tasks, people, and the unexpected hitches with impeccable poise.\nFinally, keep your schedules cleared for the 7/11/2023! Prepare for a mind-bending deep dive into another inscrutable topic - Free Will. Until then, stay quirky and keep questioning!",
