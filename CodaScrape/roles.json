Others, like Jordan Peterson, argue that there is value to the sacrifice of marriage, and that “Societies function less violently when there’s one woman per man.” So, Is it possible to simultaneously be in love with more than one person? What is the role of marriage? Should we allow children to be raised in polyamorous homes? Modern humans are currently running an experiment testing the necessity of monogamy.
